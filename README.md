                                              Deep learning project

we  built convolutional neural networks architecture and trained the model on FER(2013) dataset for Emotion recognition and classification. After classifying the input data we have maped it to the corresponding emoji. Technologies:- Language: Python Libraries: numpy , keras , OpenCV, tkinter(for GUI)
